HealthTracker is a project spun from the collective minds of Charles Thompson
and Robert Gonzalez. It is a simple application that allows people to work
toward their improved health by way of tracking nutrition and exercise.

Both Charles and Robert suffered from obesity and poor health for far too long.
This application is part of their journey to living the life they should have
been living all along. You ready for this?
